# üåå NEOvision: Near-Earth Object Tracker ‚òÑÔ∏è

**NEOvision** is an interactive visualization dashboard built with **Streamlit** and powered by data from **NASA JPL's SBDB Close-Approach API** combined with custom **Machine Learning predictions**. It tracks, classifies, and visualizes Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) based on their physical and orbital characteristics ‚Äî helping identify potential hazards to Earth.

## üìä Data Format: `neos_labeled.csv`

Your dataset should include the following columns:

| Column                 | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `des`                   | Designation ‚Äî Short identifier for the NEO (e.g., a number or name like 2021 PDC) |
| `orbit_id`             | Orbit ID ‚Äî Identifier for the specific orbital solution or observation arc|
| `jd`                 | Julian Date ‚Äî The close approach time in Julian date format |
| `cd`             | Calendar Date ‚Äî Human-readable close approach datetime (e.g., 2029-04-13 21:46)|
| `dist`                | Nominal Distance ‚Äî Best estimate of distance from Earth at closest approach (in AU)|
| `dist_min` | Minimum Distance ‚Äî Minimum possible distance at closest approach (in AU)|
| `dist_max` | Maximum Distance ‚Äî Maximum possible distance at closest approach (in AU)|
|`v_rel`| Relative Velocity ‚Äî Velocity relative to Earth at closest approach (in km/s)|
|`v_inf`| Velocity Infinity ‚Äî Velocity of the object at infinity (used in orbital mechanics) (km/s)|
|`t_sigma_f`| Timing Uncertainty ‚Äî Uncertainty in the close-approach time (in seconds or days)|
|`h`| Absolute Magnitude ‚Äî Brightness of the object; used to estimate size|
|`diameter`| Estimated Diameter ‚Äî Size of the NEO in kilometers (estimated from h if not measured)|
|`diameter_sigma`| Diameter Uncertainty ‚Äî Uncertainty in the diameter estimate (in km)|
|`fullname`| Full Name ‚Äî Full designation of the NEO, including catalog ID|
|`days_until_approach`| Days Until Approach ‚Äî Number of days from now until the close-approach date|
|`risk_level`| Risk Level (Custom) ‚Äî Custom score or label indicating severity or likelihood of threat|
|`hazardous`| Hazard Label ‚Äî Binary value (1 = potentially hazardous, 0 = not hazardous)|

```
AU (Astronomical Unit) ‚âà 149.6 million km, which is the average distance from Earth to the Sun.

Relative Velocity (v_rel) is particularly important ‚Äî high-speed NEOs can be more dangerous due to impact energy.

Absolute Magnitude (h) is used when diameter isn‚Äôt directly measured; lower h values generally indicate larger objects.

hazardous is typically defined by NASA as any object that comes within 0.05 AU and has a diameter > ~140 meters.

cd NEO-Earth-Close-Approaches-ML
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
```
python -m venv env

```

4. Launch the Streamlit dashboard
```
cd app
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Classification

The is_hazardous_prediction column in neos_labeled.csv is produced by a custom ML model that classifies NEOs as hazardous or non-hazardous based on:
- Distance from Earth (AU)
- Relative velocity (km/s)
- Estimated diameter (km)

The model was trained using historical NASA NEO data and cross-validated for reliability.

## Future Updates

Currently, the project displays the results of our inferences made while predicting the dataset we fetched by our side, will be updating this project with a real-time classification one.
